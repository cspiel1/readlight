# readlight

An ESP-01 project. A LED light for reading. Turns off after 30min and falls
into deep-sleep. With a reset button the light can be woken up. Another button
is connected to GPIO0 for switching the LED off.

A PNP transistor amplifier has to be used in order to supply enough power for
the LED.
